   greenhouse gases witch collect the sun's heat like a blanket. 2.That can be a 
   problem because of all the carbon dioxide that is being added into the atmosphere.
   Making the heat warmer witch can cause other climate change's.Such as big ice sheets 
   falling into the oceans making sea level's rising.8.In the past 100 years sea 
   level has risen about 5 inches. As the heat tempture heating up we can get bigger 
   storms and even more heat.9. 10.Water vapor is the most abundant greenghouse gas but 
   importantly reacts to as feedback to climate. 11.Earth's atmosphere has four gases 
   1.Nitrogen is the most abundant gas it comprises 79.07 persent.2.Oxygen take up 21.94 
   persent space in the atmosphere.3.Argon takes 0.94 persent.4.And last one carbon 
   dioxide takes 0.036 persent. 12.Greenhouse gases keep the heat close to the earth's 
   suface so that we humans can live one a liveable planent</p>
