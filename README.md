   3. how can we tell peolpe about this problems?
   4. what can we do all together to slow down the 
   earth's tempture heat rise?
   5. what can global warming do?
   6. Global warming can increase the Earth's average suface tempture caused by greenhouse gases witch collect the sun's heat like a blanket.
   7.That can be a problem because of all the carbon dioxide that is being added into the atmosphere.
   Making the heat warmer witch can cause other climate change's.Such as big ice sheets falling into the oceans making      sea level's rising.8.In the past 100 years sea level has risen about 5 inches.
   As the heat tempture heating up we can get bigger storms and even more heat.9.
   10.Water vapor is the most abundant greenghouse gas but importantly reacts to as feedback to climate.
   11.Earth's atmosphere has four gases 1.Nitrogen is the most abundant gas it comprises 79.07 persent.2.Oxygen take up 21.94 persent space in the atmosphere.3.Argon takes 0.94 persent.4.And last one carbon dioxide takes 0.036 persent.
   12.Greenhouse gases keep the heat close to the earth's suface so that we humans can live one a liveable planent
